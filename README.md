An AI Racecar that learns how to drive around a track using a genetic algorithm. The car uses ray casting to feed the neural network information about its
surroundings, along with its speed and direction. The neural network uses the sigmoid activation function and 1 hidden layer with 28 nodes. Both the
neural network and matrix libraries are coded from scratch for learning purposes. The project and some code was inspired by and follows the work of The Coding Train and The Code Bullet.
